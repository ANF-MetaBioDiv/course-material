The option `-bg` allows you to run the workflow as a background job, meaning that you can close your ssh connection, connect later to your VM, the workflow will still be running as long as the VM is running. Remove this option if you want to visualise progress bars. With `-r` you can call a specific version of the workflow you want to use, this is highly recommended for reproducibility purpose. With `-profile` you can call lists of pre set parameters. In our case we are calling the profile `docker` telling nextflow to download and use docker images of the tools needed for our workflow. With -c you can call a file with workflow execution configurations. Here we use configurations from `practicals/ampliseq_files/ampliseq_vm.config` to specify the maximum amount of ressources allocated to our workflow. Finally we are calling the parameters file `practicals/ampliseq_files/ampliseq_parameters_simple.yaml`. This where you will for exemple specify the primers used for the amplification.
